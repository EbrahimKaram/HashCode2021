## The naive Algorithm
Well currently streets lamps just cycle through on the intersections. We just turn on for second for each of the intersections. The tricky part is getting the intersections connected to each street. 

Now I rewrote teh naive implementation and we got the follwoiung score. 7,885,740 points
